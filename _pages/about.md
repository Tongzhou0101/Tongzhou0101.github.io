Hi, welcome to my page! I'm currently a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.northeastern.edu/coe-research/research-areas/) at Northeastern University, Boston, advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Xu](https://www.xiaolinxu.com/). Before that, I earned my master's degree from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2019, and my bachelor's degree with honors from Xidian University, Xi'an, in 2015. 

My research is centered around `AI security and privacy`, including safeguarding ML models' IP and protecting user privacy. In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, the widespread deployment of AI brings about critical challenges in security and privacy that demand attention. I am dedicated to addressing these challenges by exploring innovative solutions that mitigate risks and vulnerabilities, ultimately contributing to the advancement of trustworthy and responsible AI. 


I have recently been working on security issues in `generative AI`, with a specific emphasis on achieving reliable AI detection and implementing regulations to ensure its safe usage and mitigate the risk of abuse. **<span style="color: #3a5f0b;">If you find these topics interesting and would like to collaborate, please feel free to send me an email.</span>** :smile:
