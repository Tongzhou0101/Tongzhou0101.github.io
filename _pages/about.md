Hi, I am Tong (周桐 in Chinese) and welcome to my page! I'm currently a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.northeastern.edu/coe-research/research-areas/) at Northeastern University, Boston, advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Xu](https://www.xiaolinxu.com/). Before that, I earned my master's degree from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2019, and my bachelor's degree with honors from Xidian University, Xi'an, in 2015. 

My research focuses on three key areas in  artificial intelligence (AI): `security, privacy, and efficiency`. This involves protecting the intellectual property of machine learning (ML) models, safeguarding user privacy, and optimizing the deployment of these models. I am dedicated to developing innovative solutions that mitigate risks and vulnerabilities in the application of ML models, ultimately contributing to the advancement of trustworthy and efficient AI. 


I have recently been working on security issues in `generative AI`, with a specific emphasis on achieving reliable AI detection and implementing regulations to ensure its safe usage and mitigate the risk of abuse. **<span style="color: #3a5f0b;">If you find these topics interesting and would like to collaborate, please feel free to send me an email.</span>** :smile:
