Hi, welcome to my page! I'm currently a third-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.northeastern.edu/coe-research/research-areas/) at Northeastern Univeristy, Boston, advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Xu](https://www.xiaolinxu.com/). Before that, I got my master's degree from Univerity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2019, and my bechelor's degress from Xidian University, Xi'an, in 2015. 

My research is centered around `AI security and privacy`, including safeguarding ML models' IP and protecting user privacy. In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, the widespread deployment of AI brings about critical challenges in security and privacy that demand attention. I am dedicated to addressing these challenges by exploring innovative solutions that mitigate risks and vulnerabilities, ultimately contributing to the advancement of trustworthy and responsible AI.
