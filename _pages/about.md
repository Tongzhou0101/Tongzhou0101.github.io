Hi, welcome to my page! I'm currently a third-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.northeastern.edu/coe-research/research-areas/) at Northeastern Univeristy, Boston, advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Xu](https://www.xiaolinxu.com/). Before that, I got my master's degree from Univerity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2019, and my bechelor's degress from Xidian University, Xi'an, in 2015. 

My research is centered around `AI security and privacy`, including safeguarding ML models' IP and protecting user privacy. In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, the widespread deployment of AI brings about critical challenges in security and privacy that demand attention. I am dedicated to addressing these challenges by exploring innovative solutions that mitigate risks and vulnerabilities, ultimately contributing to the advancement of trustworthy and responsible AI. 


I have recently been working on security issues in `generative AI`, with a specific emphasis on achieving reliable AI detection and implementing regulations to ensure its safe usage and mitigate the risk of abuse. If you find these topics interesting and would like to collaborate, please feel free to send me an email. :smile
