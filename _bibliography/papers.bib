abstract={Deep neural network (DNN) models are vulnerable to misuse by attackers who try to adapt them to other tasks. Existing defenses focus on model parameters, neglecting architectural-level defenses. This paper introduces ArchLock, a method utilizing neural architecture search (NAS) and zero-cost proxies to generate models with low transferability, hindering attackers' attempts. ArchLock maintains high performance on the original task while minimizing performance on potential target tasks.},

  abstract={NNSplitter is a novel IP protection scheme for DNN models, dividing them into an obfuscated portion stored in normal memory and model secrets stored in secure memory. The obfuscated model, with perturbed weights, hampers attackers' efforts, while authorized users accessing secure memory achieve high performance. This approach ensures protection against adaptive attacks, maintaining security for DNN models.},
